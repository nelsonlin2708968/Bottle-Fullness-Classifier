# Bottle-Fullness-Classifier

Goal: Train a custom model for the bottle fullness dataset classification problem. General training methods include:
* Dropout
* Batch normalization
* l1-norm & l2-norm penalization
Data: 14300 Train, 3500 Test, 700 Validation. The data is ordered with 3k images for each category of fullness from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Data was aggregated and labeled by a class of deep learning students at Columbia University.
Architecture: similar to VGG but smaller network.
